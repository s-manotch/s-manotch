# 👋 Hi, I’m @s-manotch

👀 I'm investing 10,000 hours to master something — still loading... █████░░░ 60%  
🌱 Currently learning all things *Operations*: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes...  
💞️ Looking to collaborate on something meaningful... or just cool  
📫 Reach me:  
- Instagram: [@s.manotch](https://instagram.com/s.manotch)  
- Here. You're already here. 👈

😎 Pronouns: mho, ohm, sb, manotch (choose your fighter)  
🧩 Fun fact: There are 10 types of people in the world — those who understand binary, and those who don’t.  
⏳ Motto: Time and tide wait for no man. Neither does my CI pipeline.

## 💻 Random Command I Copy-Paste Daily

```bash
git pull && go build main.go && docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```
Because real ops don’t type — they **reuse!!!**.

## 🎯 My Goal

To be *so good they can’t ignore me*.  
To *focus like a monk* and stack 10,000 hours like LEGO blocks.  
To *solve problems*, break things (intentionally), and fix them better.

## 🤐 Bonus Ice-Breaker Jokes (deadpan guaranteed)

- I'm in a relationship... with CI/CD.
- My Kubernetes cluster ghosted me. Guess it wasn't *persistent* enough.
- My containers are more stable than my sleep schedule.
- I don't always debug, but when I do... it's in production.
